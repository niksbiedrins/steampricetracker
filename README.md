# ðŸŽ® Steam Price Tracker

A full-stack Flask web application that tracks Steam game prices, stores historical price data in a database, and sends real-time Discord notifications when prices change.

This project was built to explore API integration, background task scheduling, and database persistence â€” and to make tracking game discounts easier.
